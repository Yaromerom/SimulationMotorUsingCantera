Simulation Motor using Cantera with hidrogen and methane mix with air

This project shows the model of an HCCI engine using quarry, for an engine mixed with different percentages of fuel for hydrogen and methane with air, 
finally obtaining different regimes for the P-V diagram and indications of multimedia pressures.
